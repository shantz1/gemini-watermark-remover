# Changelog

## 1.0.23 - 2026-06-14

### Video

- Fixed the browser video ONNX runtime shape mismatch reported in issue #77 by routing small watermarks to the 104px FDnCNN model and standard or unknown watermarks to the 200px model.
- Added fixed-shape ROI planning and resize fallbacks so every detected video watermark candidate feeds the ONNX runtime with the selected model's expected input size.
- Moved the runtime padding fallback into the video export layer so direct video exports avoid the same fixed-shape mismatch.
- Fixed portrait video framing in the local before/after preview so the bottom-right watermark region remains visible during review.
- Reduced Veo text watermark detection search work and added cooperative progress yielding so the video page stays responsive while detection is running.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage across the video watermark catalog, including standard, inset, compact, scaled, portrait, 4K, oversized 8K, and undersized-canvas ROI cases.
- Added release-safety checks to prevent the video app and website runtime bundle from returning to a fixed 200px model or hard-coded 64px padding path.
- Clarified the release scope for public notes: current image defaults and guarded image improvements are releasable, while video cleanup remains review-scoped until the release gates promote it.

## 1.0.22 - 2026-06-14

### Watermark Removal

- Added support for the newly observed near-official Gemini large-margin anchor reported by the 2026-06-13 sample.
- Added evidence-gated small-anchor relocation for visible fixed-local residuals and stronger mid-alpha tuning for high-confidence 48px large-margin residuals.
- Kept unsafe-looking remaining candidates out of the production path when lower residual scores produced visible dark edge artifacts.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for the 2026-06-13 anchor, small-anchor relocation, and stronger mid-alpha selection.
- Re-verified the external Gemini watermark sample set with 186 of 189 samples passing and no newly failing samples.

## 1.0.21 - 2026-06-12

### SDK / CLI

- Added the `@pilio/gemini-watermark-remover/video` SDK entrypoint for local video watermark removal with injectable processors and a Playwright-backed preview-page default.
- Re-exported video helpers from the Node SDK and added CLI routing for `.mp4`, `.webm`, and `.mov` inputs.
- Added CLI flags for video page selection, denoise backend selection, timeout control, and low-confidence export handling.

### Video

- Added the browser AI cleanup path used by the local video preview exporter, including adjacent-frame reuse telemetry for faster repeated watermark regions.

## 1.0.20 - 2026-06-09

### SDK

- Moved `sharp` out of hard runtime dependencies and into an optional peer so browser consumers do not install the native Node image codec unless they need the CLI default codec.
- Documented that CLI users should install `sharp` when they want the built-in file decoder/encoder path.

## 1.0.19 - 2026-06-09

### SDK

- Published the latest Gemini watermark candidate detection improvements as a fresh npm SDK release because `1.0.18` is already present on npm.
- Kept the SDK packaging surface unchanged so Pilio can depend on the public package instead of maintaining a vendored copy.

### Quality

- Reused the already verified `1.0.18` algorithm build as the baseline for this npm-only release.

## 1.0.18 - 2026-06-08

### Watermark Removal

- Reworked the fixed-core Gemini watermark path around prioritized position and alpha candidates instead of multipass or visual post-processing.
- Added diff-derived artifact scoring so alpha selection can account for residual edges, halo, and newly clipped pixels without treating before/after diff as the only signal.
- Added 2026-06-08 regression samples covering the latest Gemini 48px watermark variants and refined weak-alpha outcomes.

### Chrome Extension

- Moved official extension release packages to the top-level `release/` directory while keeping the unpacked local debugging extension in `dist/extension`.

### Quality

- Documented the fixed-core algorithm findings and the next evolution plan for candidate ranking reports, gold-set manifests, and catalog-driven maintenance.
- Re-verified the release with full tests, production build, sample artifact generation, and extension package generation.

## 1.0.17 - 2026-06-07

### Watermark Removal

- Added support for the newly observed Gemini 48px watermark at the 96px right/bottom anchor.
- Added prioritized alpha-strength selection so the new weak-alpha chain tries 60% strength first and falls back to the standard 100% chain when needed.
- Kept legacy 96px and 192px-margin candidates evidence-gated so older and full-size outputs continue to resolve safely.

### Quality

- Added 2026-06-07 regression samples covering the weak-alpha 48px/96px-anchor output.
- Re-verified the current sample benchmark set with all 23 samples passing.

## 1.0.16 - 2026-05-21

### Chrome Extension

- Added the extension version to the bottom of the popup so installed builds are easier to identify.
- Reused fullscreen image session state after Gemini copy actions so refreshed `blob:` images no longer trigger visible page re-processing.
- Kept copy fallback results in the full-quality session cache so later copy and download actions can reuse the processed image.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for fullscreen dialog action hints, clipboard fallback caching, and refreshed fullscreen image reuse.

## 1.0.15 - 2026-05-20

### Watermark Removal

- Added support for the updated Gemini 96px watermark alpha map and 192px right/bottom anchor used by newly observed 2K outputs.
- Tightened candidate selection so clean canonical 48px/96px anchors are preserved when smaller preview-anchor candidates leave stronger residual edges.
- Kept preview-anchor cleanup eligible for its own warp and edge-cleanup refinement path, avoiding regressions on real Gemini preview fixtures.

### Quality

- Added regression fixtures for the new Gemini watermark position, updated 2026-05-20 sample images, and the alternate 96px alpha template.
- Re-verified full tests, production build, and sample benchmark coverage for the current sample set.

## 1.0.14 - 2026-05-03

### Userscript

- Switched userscript auto-update metadata to the GitHub Release `latest/download` permalink so the update endpoint is controlled by the published release assets.

### Quality

- Updated regression coverage to pin the release-backed userscript auto-update URL.

## 1.0.13 - 2026-05-03

### Userscript

- Added hosted `@downloadURL` and `@updateURL` metadata so userscript managers can auto-update from the official userscript permalink.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for the hosted userscript auto-update metadata.

## 1.0.12 - 2026-04-29

### Chrome Extension

- Updated the extension popup to use English copy by default for Chrome Web Store submission.
- Refined the popup visual design with Apple-style spacing, softer panels, a unified blue accent, inline action icons, and a GitHub feedback entry.
- Shortened the extension name to `Gemini Watermark Remover` in the Manifest V3 metadata.

### Quality

- Rebuilt the Chrome extension release artifacts and re-verified the extension build, compatibility adapter, and active cleanup coverage.

## 1.0.11 - 2026-04-17

### Chrome Extension

- Added a Manifest V3 Chrome extension build that packages the shared userscript runtime through a Tampermonkey-compatible adapter.
- Added the extension popup with an enable toggle, official website link, general watermark remover link, and GitHub issue feedback entry.
- Added a versioned extension release package flow that generates a zip, sha256 checksum, and `latest-extension.json` for GitHub Release and official website downloads.

### SDK

- Added the new public `runtime-browser` entrypoint as a side-effect-free blob processor for downstream browser consumers.
- Added the new public `runtime-userscript` entrypoint as a narrow userscript runtime wrapper with explicit initialize/process/remove/dispose methods.
- Published type declarations for both runtime entrypoints so packed TypeScript consumers can import them directly.

### Tooling

- Updated package exports and published file allowlists so `pnpm pack` now includes the runtime entrypoints and their required shared implementation files.
- Added isolated consumer smoke coverage that validates runtime subpath imports and rejects deep private imports from `@pilio/gemini-watermark-remover/src/...`.
- Documented Chrome extension installation in both README files and added release checklist coverage for extension artifacts.

### Quality

- Added runtime-focused regression tests for side-effect-free browser imports, default processing options, detached runtime methods, and userscript worker fallback behavior.
- Added extension build, compatibility, popup, release metadata, and README ordering regression coverage.
- Re-verified the release with targeted page/runtime/sdk/package-consumer tests and a fresh publish dry run for version `1.0.11`.

## 1.0.10 - 2026-04-07

### Userscript

- Let preview request interception fail open for passive preview fetches so Gemini can keep rendering the original page image when request-layer preview processing fails.
- Hardened fullscreen Gemini copy so stale processed object URLs no longer fall back to CSP-blocked `fetch(blob:...)`; the clipboard hook now reprocesses Gemini's own clipboard image payload when needed.
- Stabilized fullscreen preview replacement by reusing session-stored preview source bindings for blob-backed dialog images and prioritizing fullscreen images ahead of queued preview work.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for stale fullscreen clipboard object URLs, fullscreen preview source reuse from the shared image session, and fullscreen-priority page replacement queue behavior.
- Re-verified the release with a fresh full automated test run, production build, and Tampermonkey userscript freshness check against the fixed profile.

## 1.0.9 - 2026-03-31

### Userscript

- Removed Gemini-original source confirmation from the local app flow and now rely on the user to decide whether the input should be processed.
- Simplified local status messaging so skipped cases are described as "no removable watermark detected" instead of claiming Gemini-specific source knowledge.
- Removed the unused `exifr` dependency after deleting the abandoned original-source validation path.

### Tooling

- Disabled browser caching for the local dev static server so the active `pnpm dev` port, starting from `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`, is less likely to keep serving stale bundles during watermark validation work.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage to ensure the app no longer imports Gemini original-source validation helpers and locale files no longer ship the removed origin-confirmation copy.
- Re-verified the release with a fresh full test run, sample benchmark, and production build.

## 1.0.8 - 2026-03-31

### Userscript

- Fixed Gemini origin confirmation for metadata-stripped inputs by falling back to actual image dimensions instead of EXIF-only width and height fields.
- Expanded the recognized Gemini size catalog to cover the current tall and wide sample outputs used by the project fixtures.
- Softened the non-confirmed origin status copy so confirmed removal quality is no longer described as "not Gemini" when the source is only unconfirmed.

### Tooling

- Removed the local-browser dependency from `benchmark:samples` and `export:samples`; both scripts now decode and encode fixtures through the Node pipeline directly.
- Updated local regression fixtures and tests to use the remaining WebP sample set as the active release baseline.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for no-EXIF origin fallback and Node-only sample decoding/export flows.
- Re-verified the release with full automated tests, SDK smoke validation, sample benchmark/export runs, and a production build.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-03-31

### Userscript

- Improved watermark anchor recovery for near-official portrait outputs and preview-sized Gemini images that drift away from the default anchor.
- Stopped harmful extra removal passes earlier when the first pass already clears the watermark-shaped residual well enough.
- Kept preview-anchor cleanup on the cheaper edge-cleanup path instead of reintroducing expensive no-op subpixel sweeps.

### Quality

- Added regression coverage for anchor recovery, pass stopping, and release metadata consistency.
- Added the single-pass versus multipass tradeoff note used during this release cycle.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-03-30

### Userscript

- Unified Gemini preview, fullscreen, clipboard, and download actions around a shared image-session and `actionContext` pipeline.
- Reused processed session resources across surfaces so fullscreen copy/download can resolve the same processed image identity more reliably.
- Removed deprecated userscript legacy intent aliases from the active runtime path to simplify release behavior before shipping.

### Quality

- Added focused coverage for `actionContext`, shared image-session resolution, and userscript hook behavior after the release cleanup.
- Re-verified the release with a fresh full test run and production build.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-03-20

### Userscript

- Simplified Gemini page-image replacement into smaller shared helpers for processing preparation, mutation routing, source dispatch, and result application.
- Simplified Gemini original-blob acquisition so preview urls use rendered capture, download urls use background fetch, and inline urls stay on direct fetch.
- Simplified Gemini download interception to keep only in-flight request deduplication instead of retaining processed response cache entries.

### Quality

- Added focused regression coverage for preview/original source dispatch, candidate image collection, mutation scheduling, and self-written processed blob detection.
- Re-verified the release with full automated tests and a fresh production build.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-03-19

### Userscript

- Added in-page Gemini preview replacement so page images can be processed before manual download.
- Routed preview fetching through `GM_xmlhttpRequest` when available, avoiding fallback CORS failures in userscript sandboxes.
- Added a restrained `Processing...` overlay during preview processing and made failures fail-open so the original image remains visible.
- Hardened overlay lifecycle cleanup to avoid stale fade callbacks removing a new processing state.

### Shared Display Path

- Kept page-image replacement behavior aligned with the userscript preview pipeline and processing-state UX.

### Quality

- Added regression tests for userscript version sync and processing overlay lifecycle edge cases.
- Verified release build with full automated test coverage and production bundle generation.
